<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this competition, there were three stages. In the first stage, we had to take a test on physics to prove we were at the top percentage.
  For the next stage, we were given a random experiment (pancake rotation in our case) and we had to dicuss the factors that affected it and write a report on our experiment.
  Finally, the last stage was physics debate, where we presented our experiments to other teams and we debated about the posible flaws and whose experiment discussed more factors etc.<br>

When I first entered high school, I saw a poster about joining the debate team,
 so I studied the debate topic, joined the audition, and got selected into the school debate team. In the debate team, we debated with ourselves and in competitions
 in competitions with other schools about topics like whether mandatory military service in Taiwan should be elongated, if women should be included in the mandatory military service in Taiwan, 
 if AI art should be allowed, Taiwan college EMI coureses, etc. I led the discussion of combining and choosing different perspectives, how to utillize evidence and what the general strategy should be.
