<p1>I joined Renx International to work with the technical team in providing a tailor-made solution to a research center under the Taiwan Academia Sinica and Taiwan ITRI (Industrial Technology Research Institute), two of the companyâ€™s Taiwanese prestigious clients, who have been very well-known in researching technical leading solutions to environmental engineering. Under the guidance of the engineers and technicians, I helped prepare, sort,
  and assemble a wide range of machinery components. I also participated in various experiments Renx engineering team did in its local manufacturing facilities before they introduced the product prototypes to their customers.
