    <p1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was very young, my family and I had multiple relocations worldwide. Therefore, I had a great experience interacting with different people around the world, and learning all about different cultures. For example, when I was at the British School of Brussels (BSB) and joined the Boy Scouts, we did lots of camping and natural exploration. We had the chance to exchange stories with each other and get inspired by different ideas. Thus, when I heard about the global exchange program our high school held with the French school Le Gymnase Site De Jean Sturm, I had to join in.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cultural exchange lasted for two weeks. My family and I acted as a homestay during this period. It was an eye-opening experience for me because I used to stereotypically think that French people mostly ate bread like baguettes and croissants. It was a surprise to me when I found out that Antoine, my “exchange partner,” had a gluten intolerance and needed to stay away from anything made of wheat. As most of our proudest traditional Taiwanese breakfasts, for example, are made of flour, such as egg pancakes, clay-oven rolls with deep-fried bread sticks, and meat buns, etc., we had to go for a plan B. We had to come up with many different food options because we had to avoid wheat and condiments like soy sauce. Thus, we made gluten-free versions of famous Taiwanese or other Asian dishes, such as egg fried rice, pork rib and turnip soup, and seafood rice noodles. We also needed to decide where to take him during his free time after school.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the school had already planned trips to different museums and attractions like the National Palace Museum, we had to come up with other places that were representative of our Taiwanese culture and might be inspiring to him. We decided to take him to Taipei 101, Guanghua Digital Plaza, and Fort Santo Domingo. 
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taipei 101 is the most famous and symbolic building in Taipei (and in the entire Asia). We led him to get a bird's eye view of the whole city and understand the engineering and the workings of the damper and the design of the amazing architecture. 
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guanghua Digital Plaza is a digital products marketplace, where a 5-story building houses more than 600 technical products and service providers. You can imagine the extreme density and the availability of technology in this place. As Antoine was really interested in technology, he loved spending the entire afternoon and evening there.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamsui Old Street and Fort Santo Domingo illuminate and showcase the diversity of Taiwan, the Formosa island, whose history has been heavily influenced by Spain and Dutch colonization and Japan’s temporary reign of Taiwan. Walking on Tamsui's old street gave Antoine a real-life experience of how local Taiwanese trade is traditional, including children’s toys, such as Taiwanese yoyo (diabolo), shuttlecock, and spinning tops, etc. Also, he tasted lots of delicious Taiwanese cuisine at the outdoor market. Visiting Fort Santo Domingo impressed him a lot because the cannons and castles were somewhat similar to those castles built in France, but in red, an entirely unpredictable yet artistic tone of color.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this experience, I realized how important it is to avoid presuming stereotypes before meeting others. A substantial prejudice towards other people can be very misleading because everyone is different and has grown up with different experiences. We should not expect everyone to have the same behavior. For example, if I had been influenced by social media and thought that French people, including Antoine, are always prone to strikes and take a lot of time off; I would have been absolutely wrong because Antoine shared with me that he wakes up at 5:30 am every morning and is at school as early as 7 am! 
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I totally enjoyed the interaction and learning the Global Exchange program brought. Therefore, I continued to explore more opportunities afterward. Fortunately, I was selected to attend another global cultural and academic exchange program with Waseda Junior High School and The University of Tokyo this semester. I also learned more about Japanese culture and got inspired by the Kobayashi family, my “exchange family” in Japan.
