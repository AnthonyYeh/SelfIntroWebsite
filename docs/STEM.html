This study aims to explore the application of large language models in generating stories from music.
   The motivation for this research stems from the intrinsic role of music in culture, but accurately expressing the emotional narratives within music through text is considered to be challenging.
    This study introduces an approach to ensure that stories encapsulate the emotional fluctuations present in the music.
     With the advancement of large language models, we have witnessed their applications in various creative domains.
      The objective of this research is to develop a system that takes music as input and produces stories sentimentally embedded within the music, demonstrating a proof of concept by combining multiple models.
       The study utilizes tools such as PyTorch and investigates shared representations of text and music as a means to achieve emotional alignment between these mediums of communication.
        The results of the research indicate that the models for music and text emotion recognition perform well, and a complete generation process has been developed. 
        In short, there are currently models that directly generate music, and there are also models that integrate music into an introduction, but there is no model that generates stories based on the emotions in the music. Our research is to solve this problem by utilizing our models trained for  music and text emotion recognition with  the LLaMA 2 public pre-trained model to generate stories with emotional fluctuations similar to the target music. We also propose to train a GAN  model that can directly transform music into emotionally homogeneous tales by combining STFT-represented music, vectorized text of the corresponding tale, and the vectorized topic of the tale into an image to train the discriminator and then the generator. </dd>
